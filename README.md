# Autonomous Drone Navigation with A* Path Planning

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the course "RA 501." The aim is to create an autonomous drone navigation capable of maneuvering through a simulated environment with obstacles. The primary objectives are to achieve stable flight and implement efficient path planning algorithms for navigation in complex arenas.

## Key Components and Methodology

### Arena Creation
A simulated environment is designed to mimic a realistic setting with buildings acting as obstacles, challenging the drone's navigation capabilities.

### Drone Selection
The **Crazyflie drone** is chosen due to its agility and suitability for simulated environments, making it ideal for testing navigation algorithms.

### Stabilization
A **PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller** is implemented to maintain the drone's stability during flight, accounting for environmental disturbances.

### Point-to-Point Navigation
The drone is programmed to autonomously navigate from one specified point to another within the arena.

### Node Class Development
A custom **Node class** is developed to manage navigation by storing information about neighboring nodes, calculating GPS coordinates, and identifying obstacle nodes.

### Path Planning
The **A* algorithm** is utilized for path planning to determine the most efficient route from the start point to the destination while avoiding obstacles.

### Path Following
The drone autonomously follows the path generated by the A* algorithm, moving from the start node to the goal node.

### Obstacle Sensing
Equipped with sensors, the drone detects obstacles in its path. Upon detection, it hovers, marks the obstacle node, and re-engages the A* algorithm to calculate a new path.

### Re-planned Path Navigation
After the path is re-planned, the drone resumes its journey, following the new path to the goal node.

### Landing Upon Goal Achievement
Once the drone reaches the goal node, it executes a safe landing, completing its navigation task.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of advanced control systems, path planning algorithms, and real-time obstacle detection and avoidance in drone technology. The successful simulation results indicate potential for real-world applications in various sectors, including surveillance, delivery services, and disaster management.
